      <h2>Project Summary</h2>

      <h3>Week 1 â€“ Data Exploration and Mapping</h3>
      <p>We began by processing raw sequencing reads into genomic bins and mapping them to reference regions. We explored variability in coverage and examined GC-content bias patterns using descriptive statistics and visual tools. This stage built the foundation for understanding systematic bias in sequencing data.</p>

      <h3>Week 2 â€“ Statistical Modeling of GC Bias</h3>
      <p>We developed regression models to describe the relationship between read coverage and GC content. Both <b>Weighted Least Squares (WLS)</b> and <b>Cubic Spline regression</b> were fitted to estimate the smooth function f(GC) representing expected coverage as a function of GC content. This established the baseline for normalization and later CNV detection.</p>

      <h3>Week 5 â€“ Model Comparison and Residual Analysis</h3>
      <p>This lab focused on comparing performance across different bin resolutions (1K, 2.5K, 5K, and 10K). We evaluated biasâ€“variance trade-offs using <b>MAE</b>, <b>Median Absolute Error</b>, and residual analysis. Models included <b>LOESS</b> and <b>Cubic Spline</b> corrections. The results guided the choice of optimal bin size for robust CNV detection.</p>

      <h3>Week 6 â€“ Model Refinement and Simulation Design</h3>
      <p>This stage bridged empirical modeling and theoretical simulation. We refined the spline-based correction model and introduced <b>Poisson regression</b>, modeling coverage as Y<sub>k</sub> ~ Poisson(Î›<sub>k</sub>), where Î›<sub>k</sub> = f(GC<sub>k</sub>) + Îµ<sub>k</sub>. Different estimation strategies were explored â€” <b>MLE</b>, <b>Method of Moments</b>, and <b>MAD</b> â€” for the variance parameter ÏƒÂ². The analysis also examined <i>UnderSpread</i> and <i>OverSpread</i> behavior using <b>Cubic</b> vs. <b>Natural Splines</b>, forming the basis for the later simulation study.</p>

      <h3>Week 7 â€“ Data Cleaning and Copy Number Estimation</h3>
      <p>Using the cleaned coverage data (2.5K-bin resolution), we applied spline-based correction to compute copy number estimates (aáµ¢). Outlier filtering via <b>LOESS residuals</b> and <b>IQR trimming</b> improved normalization accuracy. The resulting aáµ¢ distribution confirmed diploid coverage near 1 and identified local CNV deviations.</p>

      <h3>Week 8 â€“ Simulation and Model Validation</h3>
      <p>The final lab implemented a <b>Poisson-based simulation framework</b> to mimic GC-dependent sequencing bias. We estimated the Poisson variance parameter (Ïƒ), generated synthetic datasets with realistic coverage variability, and compared them to observed data using <b>RMSE</b> between fitted and true f(GC) curves. This simulation validated the reliability and interpretability of the modeling approach.</p>

      <h3>Final Presentation â€“ Comprehensive CNV Analysis</h3>
      <p>The final presentation summarized the complete CNV detection pipeline developed throughout the semester. We compared the performance of <b>Model B, Model C, and Model D</b>, each representing a variation in GC-correction and residual filtering using <b>LOESS</b> and <b>Cubic Spline</b> functions. Key evaluation criteria included the proportion of bins retained after IQR-based outlier filtering, <b>Mean Absolute Error</b>, and the stability of coverage across genomic regions (e.g., 26.5Mâ€“28.5M). The analysis demonstrated that combining GC correction with adaptive smoothing (Spline + LOESS) provided the most consistent and biologically interpretable results. This final stage integrated all prior modeling, simulation, and correction steps into a cohesive and validated CNV detection workflow.</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Across all stages, we integrated statistical reasoning, computational modeling, and visualization in <b>R</b> to analyze and correct sequencing coverage data. Each lab reflected a deeper layer of insight â€” from exploratory analysis to model fitting, correction, and simulation â€” culminating in a reproducible CNV detection pipeline grounded in sound biostatistical principles.</p>
